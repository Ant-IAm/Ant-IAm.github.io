Train Sim World is a First-Person Train Simulator that brings to life the experience of operating powerful and realistic trains on some of the Worldâ€™s most amazing railways utilising the power of Unreal Engine 4. We support PC ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/530070/Train_Sim_World/), [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/train-sim-world-digital-deluxe-edition/c43xbsl9mk77?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)), [PS4](https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2866-CUSA10019_00-DTGTRAINSIMWORLD) and [Xbox one](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/train-sim-world-digital-deluxe-edition/c43xbsl9mk77?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). As of creating this post we have [16 pieces of DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/530070/Train_Sim_World/#browse) which include both routes and vehicle packs, 15 of which I have personally worked on.

### Development Responsibilities:
* Developing all aspects of simulating a rail vehicle, using a strong understanding of UE4's blueprint scripting language.
* Create flexible and robust C++ components for Rail Vehicle Actors used by the setup team.
* Use profiling tools such as UE4's profiler and Microsoft Pix (Xbox) to find potential optimisations that can be made, predominantly to Rail Vehicles. This usually results in helping to guide other departments in optimisations that can be made.
* Study and fix bugs leveraging the QA team.

### Organisation and Admin tasks
* Scoping out and working with management to plan scheduling for future DLC.
* Research, design and implement prototypical locomotive and rolling stock functionality.
* Creating and managing ticketing for tasks, bugs and queries using Jira.
* Self management of time spent on tasks.
* Create and manage internal documentation used to store standards for Rail Vehicle properties and components, as well as important information that is discovered during development.
* Perform blueprint and sometimes code reviews during submissions.
